# QA plan

## Automated suites

Run everything with `npm test`. Each suite exits non-zero on failure, so it
drops straight into CI.

### `npm run test:geometry` — geometry primitives
Guards the swept-surface builder that every asset is made from. The regression
that motivated it: profiles swept in −Y came out with inverted winding, which
made trouser legs, sleeves and shoulders render inside-out. The test asserts
that walls face outward and caps face opposite ways for sweeps along +Y, −Y
and −Z.

### `npm run test:fairness` — the fairness engine
- 15 hand-built cases covering jumpable, slideable, full-height, chained and
  rooftop layouts, plus the cases that *must* be rejected (all three lanes
  walled; a jump and a slide 0.6 m apart; a train roof with no ramp).
- A sweep of all 44 authored segment templates at 5 speeds from 12 to 31 m/s.
- A 12,000-segment generator soak across the whole difficulty curve, where
  every shipped segment is independently re-verified by a fresh solver.

Pass criterion: **zero** shipped segments without a survivable route.

### `npm run test:soak` — world streaming
Runs the real TrackManager, generator, collision, coin and power-up systems
for 12 simulated minutes (~20 km) with no renderer, sampling scene object and
geometry counts each minute. Pass criterion: the second half's average is
within 15% of the first half's — i.e. the pools plateau rather than leak.

### `npm run playtest` — browser
Boots the built game in Chromium, plays it with scripted input for 45 seconds,
restarts after death, then exercises pause, resume, quit and all three menu
panels. Reports draw calls, triangles, geometry growth, sustained frame rate
and every console error. Pass criterion: **zero console errors**.

Note the frame rate from this suite is not representative: CI runs on
SwiftShader (software rasterisation). Use it for correctness and draw-call
counts, not performance.

### `npm run test:hero` — character budget
Prints triangle counts per LOD, per-part bounds and skin-weight normalisation.
Pass criterion: LOD0 within the 20k–60k budget, all weights summing to 1.

## Manual checklist

### Startup
- [ ] Loading bar advances and the screen clears completely
- [ ] Main menu shows the hero from the front, lit and animated
- [ ] Best score, distance, coins, runs and achievement count all read

### Player
- [ ] Character is visible and recognisably human at LOD0/1/2
- [ ] Run cycle stays locked to speed with no foot sliding at 11 or 31 m/s
- [ ] Jump, slide, lane change, stumble and death animations all fire
- [ ] Coyote time: a jump pressed just after leaving a roof still fires
- [ ] Jump buffering: a jump pressed just before landing still fires
- [ ] Releasing jump early gives a lower arc

### World
- [ ] Track generates continuously with no gaps or popping
- [ ] Segments recycle behind the player
- [ ] Zones transition gradually with lighting, fog and music changes
- [ ] Trains, stations, buildings, props, traffic and planting all appear

### Gameplay
- [ ] Obstacles spawn, collide, and are always survivable
- [ ] Ramps can be run up and train roofs landed on
- [ ] Coins collect; magnet attracts; combo builds and decays
- [ ] All five power-ups grant, display a timer, and expire
- [ ] Near misses score and fire their effect
- [ ] Difficulty visibly climbs over a long run

### UI
- [ ] HUD updates without stutter; nothing covers the play space
- [ ] Pause / resume / quit all work, including on tab blur
- [ ] Game over shows results, new bests, completed missions, achievements
- [ ] Restart works from game over; missions, achievements, settings all open
- [ ] Every settings control takes effect immediately

### Persistence
- [ ] Progress survives a reload
- [ ] A corrupted save falls back to defaults without blocking boot
- [ ] Private-browsing mode degrades gracefully with a visible notice

### Performance
- [ ] 60 fps on a mid-range discrete GPU at 1080p
- [ ] Quality setting visibly changes shadows, density and resolution
- [ ] Automatic quality drop triggers on sustained slow frames
- [ ] No memory growth over a 10-minute run

## Known limitations

- The hero's identity is the default config; supply a reference photo and
  fill in `HeroIdentity` to match a real person (see `HERO_PIPELINE.md`).
- LOD1 is 8.2k triangles, slightly under the bible's 10k–30k suggestion. It
  was left there deliberately: the silhouette holds at 26 m+ and the saving is
  real. LOD0 (21k) and LOD2 (3.5k) are both inside their bands.
- Frame rate has not been measured on real GPU hardware in this environment.
